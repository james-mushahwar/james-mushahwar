Game and Software Engineer
--------------------------

I am 28 years old and love to explore new possibilities with software development. I have been programming for almost 10 years. I began programming just before I started studying Computer Science (BSc), with a focus on Systems programming at University of Glasgow. I graduated with a 1st class Honours degree. I then worked or a short time after university before wanting to branch my skills into game development. <br>
<br>
I then graduated from Abertay University with a merit masters degree in Professional Game Development (MProf). Since 2021, after graduating, I have been working professionally as a Software and games engineer at a small studio, using UE 4.27. Throughout my game development journey I have always had a project that I have been working towards in my own time. These projects have predominantly used Unity, so I am well-versed in swapping between both Unity and UE. Exploring new ideas and learning are some of the ways I like to spend my precious free time.
